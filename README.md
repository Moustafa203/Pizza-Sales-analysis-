# Pizza Sales Analysis

This project focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to identify trends, customer preferences, and key performance metrics. The analysis uses **SQL** for data extraction and cleaning, and **Power BI** for creating interactive visualizations that help to uncover actionable insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, the sales data of a pizza restaurant was analyzed to provide insights on:
- **Sales Trends**: Identifying seasonal and time-based sales patterns.
- **Customer Preferences**: Analyzing the most popular pizza types and ingredients.
- **Revenue and Profitability**: Tracking revenue generation and the most profitable products.
- **Operational Performance**: Understanding sales performance across different locations, time frames, and marketing campaigns.

The data was processed using **SQL** for querying and cleaning, and **Power BI** was used to create dashboards and reports to visualize the findings.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Used SQL to extract data from sales databases and perform data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.
- **Sales Analysis**: Focused on analyzing sales patterns, customer behaviors, and product performance.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Developed interactive and visually appealing dashboards for data exploration and reporting.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Provided actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, marketing efforts, and product offerings.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Data extraction, querying, and cleaning.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization, dashboard creation, and reporting.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the raw and cleaned sales data.
- **Reports**: Includes Power BI files with dashboards and visualizations.
- **SQL Queries**: Contains the SQL queries used for data extraction and analysis.
  
## How to Run

1. Open the **Power BI** files to explore the visualizations and insights.
2. Review the **SQL Queries** folder for the queries used to extract and clean the data.
3. The project does not have executable functions, as it is primarily focused on data analysis and visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate additional data sources such as customer demographics to further enhance the analysis.
- Automate data extraction using APIs for real-time analysis.
- Expand the dashboard to track marketing campaign effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
